# UFOs
### Background
Working with a web application with a single filter for date UFO sightings given a data.js file. Now, the creater, Dana web journalist would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I added table filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape.

### Analysis
Updated the index.html, app.js files to add filters on specific data such as date, city, state, country and shape allows us to get specific data relevant to what  user is searching. 
I completed this by adding more list items under our form in the html file for UFO webpage. 

#### Results:
A working web application that allows search criteria for 5 specific filters. 
 
### Summary: 
You can search for multiple criteria by user input. You have five different search options based on UFO sightings. You can search by date, city, state, coutry and shape of UFO sightings. If you search for a particular date it will pull up all UFO sightings based on that date and information that is within our data.js file. You can search this way for any of the 5 search options. 

One drawback of this webpage is that it is limited to the data in the data.js file. 

Two additional recommendations for further development or drawbacks I see are limited data to search and filtering method. 
    1. I would recommend adding a way to clear the search data. Add a Clear search button maybe and it resets the search boxes to default so each time a user inputs something in the specific text box it would automatically repopulate the search information not just the first time the user presses enter the search has been done on that input. As of now, you have to go and clear out search input boxes. 
    
    2. I would add a way to search a broader scope of data. Right now we are limited to what is in the data file and may be hard to know what to search because every bit of information on UFO sightings in not listed in the data file.
