# UFOs
### Background
Working with a web application with a single filter for date UFO sightings given a data.js file. Now, the creater, Dana web journalist would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I added table filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape.

### Analysis
The way you would use the UFO webpage by using the search criteria input boxes available. When you pull your webpage up you will see 5 different options to input text on what you want to search that specifically relates to UFO sightings data that is in the data file we have. Here is an image of UFO webpage. Once you enter a search criteria it would have to have results that all match for it to display data. If you want just one specific search criteria then just enteria for that box to display what could have multiple sightings for particular requests like shape. If you searched just a particular shape it would show all sightings for that UFO shape. If you enter more specific data search like city and shape then it will list items that meet both city and shape criteria that user input into search box. If you put a city that is not listed in the data then it will populate a blank table because there is not data for that city. This is a drawback to our webpage in my opinion. 

the html file for UFO webpage. 

#### Results:
Completed the adding multiple search criteria or filters to our webpage by adding the necessary code to our html file. Result is a working web application that allows search criteria for 5 specific filters. 
Here is an example of the newly added search criteria for our web page. 

 
### Summary: 
You can search for multiple criteria by user input. You have five different search options based on UFO sightings. You can search by date, city, state, coutry and shape of UFO sightings. If you search for a particular date it will pull up all UFO sightings based on that date and information that is within our data.js file. You can search this way for any of the 5 search options. 

One drawback of this webpage is that it is limited to the data in the data.js file. 

Two additional recommendations for further development or drawbacks I see are limited data to search and filtering method. 
    1. I would recommend adding a way to clear the search data. Add a Clear search button maybe and it resets the search boxes to default so each time a user inputs something in the specific text box it would automatically repopulate the search information not just the first time the user presses enter the search has been done on that input. As of now, you have to go and clear out search input boxes. 
    
    2. I would add a way to search a broader scope of data. Right now we are limited to what is in the data file and may be hard to know what to search because every bit of information on UFO sightings in not listed in the data file.
